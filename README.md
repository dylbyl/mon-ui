# Make Up a Mon - UI

An Expo/React Native app to generate random ideas for Pokemon designs!

[The API endpoint allows for seeded generation](https://github.com/dylbyl/mon-api/). Meaning that a design can be truly random, OR a daily design can be generated for all users!

## Install
- [Clone and run the Make Up a Mon API](https://github.com/dylbyl/mon-api/)
- Clone this UI repo
- [Download the Expo Go app on your phone](https://expo.dev/client)
- Run `npm install`
- Run `npm start`
- Press W to run the app in your browser
- Test the app, and be amazed!

- **Note: Only do try this method later, once I get the API interacting properly, or deploy the API publicly**
- Using the Expo Go app, scan the QR code that appears
- Test the app, and be amazed!


## Dev Note
Right now, the Expo app doesn't communicate well with the API when using mobile devices. This should be fixed once I deploy the API to Heroku or AWS.
For now, please press W after running the app to launch it in your computer's browser.
